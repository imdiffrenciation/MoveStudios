## Features:
Problem

Most Web2 and Web3 content platforms fail creators due to:
	- Content theft and lack of proof of ownership
	- Unfair recommendation algorithms that favor large creators
	- Slow payouts and complex verification processes
	- Complicated user interfaces

⸻

Solution

MoveStudios is a creator-focused platform that fixes these issues by:
	- Storing a unique cryptographic hash for every piece of content via a smart contract, enabling verifiable proof of originality
	- Using a fairer recommendation algorithm that improves visibility for new and smaller creators
	- Allowing creators to receive tips instantly by simply connecting a wallet—no approval or verification required
	- Combining simple UX with Web3-level ownership and transparency
